Let any fish who meets my gaze learn the true meaning of fear;
for I am the harbinger of death. The bane of creatures sub-aqueous,
my rod is true and unwavering as I cast into the aquatic abyss.
A man, scorned by this uncaring Earth, finds solace in the sea.
My only friend, the worm upon my hook. Wriggling, writhing,
struggling to surmount the mortal pointlessness that permeates this barren world.

I am alone. I am empty. And yet, I fish.
